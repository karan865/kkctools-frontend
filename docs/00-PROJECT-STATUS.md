## 5. Known Issues / Decisions Log

- **Decision (2026-11-13):** Retitled `/cubic-yard-calculator/` to “Cubic Yard Calculator – Soil, Gravel, Mulch & More” so it no longer competes with the new `/concrete-calculator/`. Semrush shows `cubic yard calculator` and `concrete volume calculator` have different top-10 results, so each page owns one intent. The cubic-yard page body still contains concrete sections; trim them later if both pages are seen competing in Search Console.

- **Decision 01 (2026-11-08):** Use Next.js 16 App Router with static export (`output: 'export'`).
- **Decision 02 (2026-11-08):** Zero client-side network calls enforced by `scripts/check-no-network.mjs`.
- **Decision 03 (2026-11-09):** Comprehensive SEO audit and GSC readiness action plan created at `docs/SEO-AND-SEARCH-CONSOLE-AUDIT.md`. Identified `src/config/site.ts` domain replacement and live hosting deployment as the sole blockers for GSC sitemap submission.
- **Decision 04 (2026-11-10):** Visual design upgrade inspired by Cloudflare & MKSAnalytiq: warm ivory canvas (`#FFFAF2`), deep navy typography (`#17213A`), terracotta orange gradient pill CTAs (`#C2410C`), cobalt blue tool actions (`#0B5EA4`), 20px rounded cards, ambient hero glow, and pill search bar.
- **Decision 05 (2026-11-10):** Fixed theme persistence bug by resetting legacy `theme` key to `kkc_theme_pref` ensuring default is strictly Light mode. Added active route orange bar in header, 2-column "How this works" + "Related tools" sticky layout to both tool pages, and helper trust text under all buttons.
- **Decision 06 (2026-11-10):** Restored warm canvas to user-preferred soothing sand tone (`#EBE4D6`), eliminating glare and eye strain. All cards, tables, and form boxes are pure white (`#FFFFFF`) with borders (`#D8CFBF`) and soft elevation shadows (`0 4px 14px -2px rgba(23, 33, 58, 0.07)`).
- **Decision 07 (2026-11-10):** Resolved table spacing issues: increased table min-width to 940px, widened Category (170px), Quantity (100px), Unit (125px), and Rate (115px). Hidden default webkit number spin buttons to eliminate number clipping. All verified via `npm run verify`.
- **Decision 08 (2026-11-10):** Softened box surface interior (`--surface`) across the entire application from stark bright white (`#FFFFFF`) to a soothing warm parchment cream (`#F6F0E6`), eliminating harsh white glare while preserving elevation against the warm sand canvas (`#EBE4D6`) and maintaining 14.3:1 AAA text contrast. Verified via `npm run verify`.
- **Decision 09 (2026-11-10):** Dark mode upgraded to 10/10 Obsidian Carbon standard (Apple macOS / Linear aesthetic). Deep charcoal obsidian canvas (`#090C12`), elevated card surface (`#11151F`), secondary surface (`#19202D`), recessed inputs (`#0C0F17`), precision micro-borders (`#1E2636`), radiant electric cobalt blue (`#38BDF8`), amber-orange CTAs (`#F97316`), and 1px layered glass rim-light shadows. Verified zero regressions across all 21 static pages.
